# PiArt

Draws Pi as a sequence of coloured SVG rectangles.


## Why?

I was fascinated with the idea of visualizing Pi.  Calculating Pi to significant digits was once a realm only available to super computers.  I learned a few things about both the calculation itself and about the limits of Math in Javascript.
